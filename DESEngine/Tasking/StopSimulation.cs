	/// started.  Per the documentation for <see cref="Simulation.Stop()"/>,
	/// those methods do nothing if the <see cref="Simulation"/> is not
	/// running.  Therefore, to "pre-schedule" the stop time, this DesTask may be
	/// used — simply create a new <see cref="StopSimulation"/> and activate
	/// (schedule) it to occur at the time you wish the
	/// <see cref="Simulation"/> to end.
