	/// In reality, an <see cref="IResource"/> represents a <em>set</em> or
	/// <em>pool</em> of resources that may be acquired and released by
	/// <see cref="DesTask"/>s during the course of a simulation run.  Each time
	/// a resource is acquired, there is one less resource available to
	/// dispense to other <see cref="DesTask"/>s.  Each time a resource is
	/// released by a <see cref="DesTask"/>, there is one more resource available
	/// to dispense.  When all resources have been acquired, the next
	/// <see cref="DesTask"/> to call <see cref="Acquire"/> will be blocked until
	/// such time as another <see cref="DesTask"/> puts a resource back into the
	/// available pool by calling <see cref="Release"/> or
	/// <see cref="Transfer"/>.
