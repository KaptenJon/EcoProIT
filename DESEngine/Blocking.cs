    /// <see cref="Blocking&lt;T&gt;"/> is used to enforce a common idiom for
    /// all blocking objects without allowing substantially different types of
    /// blocking objects too much visibility into each other's inner-working.
    /// For example, both <see cref="DesTask"/> and <see cref="DESResource"/> are
    /// derivatives of <see cref="Blocking&lt;T&gt;"/>.  Because of this, each
    /// implements a common method for creating their blocking (wait) queues,
    /// getting a count of the number of blocked <see cref="DesTask"/>s on the
    /// wait queues, etc.  However, neither <see cref="DesTask"/> nor
    /// <see cref="DESResource"/> directly exposes the underlying wait queues
    /// to each other.  This helps ensure that dissimilar blocking objects
    /// can't intentionally or unintentionally affect each other.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Of course, by not exposing the wait queue even to sub-classes, it may
    /// make it difficult for certain functions to be carried out.  As a brief
    /// aside, the <see cref="DesTask"/> class actually does expose its wait queue
    /// to sub-classes through the <see cref="DesTask.WaitQueue"/> property, but
    /// this is not the norm for the other blocking objects.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// If you absolutely, positively need access to a blocking object's wait
    /// queue (or queues), it can be easily accomplished by overriding the
    /// <see cref="CreateBlockingQueue"/> method and simply hanging onto the
    /// returned <see cref="IQueue&lt;T&gt;"/> reference that you return to
    /// the caller.  One thing to bear in mind, however, is that most of the
    /// React.NET blocking objects create their wait queue(s) on demand, so
    /// you're not immediately guaranteed access to the wait queue using these
    /// steps.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Another consideration when sub-classing <see cref="Blocking&lt;T&gt;"/>

    /// one wait queue, but if multiple wait queues are required, they must be
    /// of the same type.  The primary reason for this restriction is that
    /// C# generics do not allow downcasting of generic types whose type
    /// parameters differ.  For example, you can't create an
    /// <see cref="IQueue&lt;AcquireConsumable&gt;"/> and return it as an
