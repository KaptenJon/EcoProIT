**EcoProIT**

This project aims to use a Discrete event simulation engine based on a modified React.NET ([http://reactnet.sourceforge.net/](http://reactnet.sourceforge.net/)) engine coupled with LCI data to calculate maximum throughput, emissions and environmental impact from product life including detailed manufacturing product life phase analyse.

The project origins from a research project from Chalmers University of Technology where the current implementation was used to demonstrate design principles on how the calculations can be made.
